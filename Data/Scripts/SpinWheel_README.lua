    1. Brief description. What does it do? What problem does it solve?
    This is a Loot/Reward system that allows creators to set up a loot table and 
    easily implement an in-game interface for players to roll for random loot, visualize 
    the odds and the result of the roll, and view a satisfying animation that reveals the reward.

    Usage
    3. Basic or most common way of using. Brief.
    
    -Customizing the "loot machine"-
    In the script "Loot_Box_Spawner", you'll find Custom Properties for each rarity of loot box.
    There are templates in the Project Content that follow the convention: "Loot_Box_rarity_theme"
    Any of these templates are interchangeable; shout out to @AwkwardGameDev and @Mucusinator for their contribution!
	All these templates are animated with the script "Loot_Box_Animation_Fantasy". reach out to @WitcherSilver for help with animations.
    When enabled, the "ChangePrizeCamera" property will override the player camera during the loot box reveal animation.
