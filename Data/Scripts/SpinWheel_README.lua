       Description:
    PERKS LootboxWheel is a component that allows creators to set up a loot table and

    the odds and the result of the roll, and view a satisfying animation that reveals the reward.

        1) LootboxGenerator
        2) LootboxSpawner
        3) DropRateSign
        4) DropTable
        5) Loot Machine Animation Fantasy
        6) Lootbox Wheel Shuffler Scripts
        7) SpinWheel
        8) Display

    -Customizing the "loot machine"-
    In the script "Loot_Box_Spawner", you'll find Custom Properties for each rarity of loot box.
    There are templates in the Project Content that follow the convention: "Loot_Box_rarity_theme"
    Any of these templates are interchangeable; shout out to @AwkwardGameDev and @Mucusinator for their contribution!
	All these templates are animated with the script "Loot_Box_Animation_Fantasy". reach out to @WitcherSilver for help with animations.
    When enabled, the "ChangePrizeCamera" property will override the player camera during the loot box reveal animation.
